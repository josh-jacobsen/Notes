# Notes

## Setting up a new Mac 

The overview at https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/ is a great place to start. 

Another good one is: https://www.chrisatmachine.com/posts/01-macos-developer-setup

As is [Robin Wieruch's](https://www.robinwieruch.de/mac-setup-web-development/)

- Install iTerm2
  - Customise navigation through use of alt & command keys  
- Install oh-my-zsh
- Install plugins
  - [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh)
  - [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh)
  - fzf search 
- Customise prompt (create in `.oh-my-zsh/custom/theme` and point `.zshrc` file to load the custom prompt)
- Create aliases (create an `aliases.zsh` file in the `.oh-my-zsh/custom` directory. This will be automatically loaded)
- Create git aliases (place in `~/.gitconfig`)

### Troubleshooting 

`iisReset`
